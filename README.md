# Cucumber-Master

The projects in this repo demonstate that a 'test framework' can be specified as the parent of a certain project. From 
this parent project, the both dependencies and profiles can be de fined. So that when multiple projects using the parent
 project, maintainment of depending projects (like page objects and configuration loading etc) can be done centrally.
